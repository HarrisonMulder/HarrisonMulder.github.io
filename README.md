This is my personal / professional website.  It contains my basic info, along with links to my e-mail, skype and all of my social media.  

My resume and work portfolio can be accessed here as well, along with a programming page containing code samples in several different languages.  

There is also a contact form available at the bottom of the page to send me an e-mail directly through the site.
